TODO:

1- Update rsmx.congnitive to v4 
2- Implement EchoBot as per v4
3- Implement Wordy as per Custom-Dialog and CoreBot (LUIS)
4- Implement Kaka (Telegram) with ServiceAuthProvider and IProviderContext

Kaka is for ProjectsNirvana. We will have Bot and BotChannel tables for capturing details about each bot.
